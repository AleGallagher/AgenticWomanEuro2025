Actualmente, Polonia tiene 3 puntos y un partido restante contra Suecia. Aquí están los escenarios posibles:\\n\\n1. **Victoria de Polonia contra Suecia:**\\n   - Si Polonia gana contra Suecia, alcanzará 6 puntos. Esto aseguraría su clasificación, ya que Suecia no podría superarlos y dependería del resultado de Dinamarca contra Suecia para determinar si Polonia termina en primer o segundo lugar.\\n\\n2. **Empate de Polonia contra Suecia:**\\n   - Si Polonia empata, alcanzará 4 puntos. En este caso, Polonia necesitaría que Suecia no gane su partido contra Alemania. Si Suecia empata o pierde contra Alemania, Polonia se clasificaría como segundo del grupo.\\n\\n3. **Derrota de Polonia contra Suecia:**\\n   - Si Polonia pierde, permanecerá con 3 puntos. En este escenario, Polonia necesitaría que Suecia pierda contra Alemania para que los tres equipos (Polonia, Suecia y Alemania) terminen con 3 puntos. La clasificación se decidiría entonces por los criterios de desempate, comenzando con los puntos obtenidos en los partidos entre estos equipos, seguido por la diferencia de goles y los goles marcados en esos partidos.\\n\\nEn resumen, para asegurar su clasificación, Polonia debe ganar su partido contra Suecia.
